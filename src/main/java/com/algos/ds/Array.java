/**
 * Array is a contiguously allocated data structure with fixed size data records.
 * Each element can be efficiently located by its index or address.
 * Pros - Memory alignment, constant time index access, space efficient.
 * Cons - Resize during runtime. (Dynamic arrays come to rescue.)
 * Dynamic Arrays - Grows size at half of the usage and results in copying the old half to new
 * first half of the location where the new size is double.
 * Physical continuity b/w successive data accesses helps exploit cache memory.
